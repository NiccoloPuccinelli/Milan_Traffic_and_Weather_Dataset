# Milan_Traffic_and_Weather_MongoDB_Dataset

Here is the work done together with my colleagues **Marco Scatassi** and **Greta Gravina**. In particular, we built a dataset concerning informations regarding the weather and the traffic in Milan, in the period between December 28, 2021 and January 10, 2022, using different **APIs**. 

We therefore carried out the various steps to create the database. Firstly, we extracted the data in real-time using the APIs provided by **TomTom** and **OpenWeather**. Next, we took care of the database integration and preparation phases, and then stored everything in the document-based **MongoDB** DBMS. Finally, a quality assessment was carried out on the dataset obtained and the elasticity of the queries.

The language chosen during all phases is **Python**.
